## My Interests 
   One of the main reasons as to why I wanted to go into the field of Computer Science is how that field can innovate and change our lifestyle. There are many creative opportunities that can happen when going into the field of Comupter Science. These opportunities can range from creating a video game that will be loved by many, to creating the algorithms that helps the journey into space. Many of these opportunities attract many people into the field and some of them attracted me. One of them would have to be creating video games. Ever since I was little, I loved to play video games. It was my escape world to where I could have fun. Because I loved to play, I started taking interests in how games were made.

## Real Life Example of A Smart Question
   [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44649988/spring-boot-actuator-health-is-not-working) is a link to a smart question that was found in StackOverflow. Immediately, the questioner is very specific on what the problem is. He gives his code and explains the steps he did when coding it. He explains that he did this code with the guidance of a tutorial page and followed it. He gives the error message that popped up the moment he thinks his code breaks and explains what he had done to attempt to solve the problem. Here this person already meets all the criteria mentioned above and asks this question within a coding community website. With this being a smart questions, there are many different respondents that were willingly to explain the steps needed to solve the problem. The respondents shared which part of his code resulted in the error and solutions on how to fix it.

## Bottom Line?
   Questions are asked to fulfill the curiosity of the mind or to solve a problem. The way one asks the question will is what you will get as your answer. A simple, not thought out question will result in answers that are short and often point out that the answer is there, you just didn't read. When a question is asked with the explanation of what you have tried to do, it makes respondents appreciate the questions and makes them happy enough to answer it.
