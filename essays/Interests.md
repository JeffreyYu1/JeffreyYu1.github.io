## My Interests 
   One of the main reasons as to why I wanted to go into the field of Computer Science is how that field can innovate and change our lifestyle. There are many creative opportunities that can happen when going into the field of Comupter Science. These opportunities can range from creating a video game that will be loved by many, to creating the algorithms that helps the journey into space. Many of these opportunities attract many people into the field and some of them attracted me. One of them would have to be creating video games. Ever since I was little, I loved to play video games. It was my escape world to where I could have fun. Because I loved to play, I started taking interests in how games were made. When I created my first mini game (game was very generic) I had a sense of accomplishment and I also had fun coding it. This made me think about all the hard work video game developers did inorder to make these games that grant people happiness. I too want to create something that would make people happy. My other interest in the field of Computer Science would be software development. Jusst thinking about how I can build algorithms that make life easier gets me excited. An example of this could be the algorithm/program for a machine that could detect that something is wrong with your body. Making something that could innovate the world excites me.

## Skill Goals
   Skills that I hope to pick up in the future of being in Computer Science would be different programming languages. Learning multiple languages can give you a range of projects that you can work on. Not everything is going to depend on the same language. The more languages you learn, the easier learning another one can be. You get used to the syntax and develop different ways to solve problems. You get to learn how to solve problems in many different ways. Learning more programming languages will make your resume look better and having more languages at your disposal gives you an advantage over others. Another skill I hope to master in the future would be my problem solving skills. Solving problems is one of the fundamental rules of programming. If one is able to solve problems fast, you can code programs in an efficient manner.

## Hopeful Experiences
   Experiences that I hope I would go through in my Computer Science path would be interns, creating my own projects, and learning from the best. What I hope is to intern or work for big name companies that could teach me about what it is like to work in the real world of software engineering. I hope that by going through this experience, I can find the areas that I am lacking in and improve in them. I also would like to pick up new skills that could help me in my path of becoming a successful Computer Scientist. What I hope to gain from creating my own projects is an expansion from my creativity. Creating many projects will also hone my skills as to what language I use. I want to experience learning from the best because I want to see how the best programmers operate during their daily lives. If I want to become the best, I would like to mimic how others became knowledgeable.
