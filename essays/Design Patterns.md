## Design Patterns as roofs?
   Many different people have explained Design Patterns in many different ways. To me, Design Patterns can be thought as roofs. One can pose the question, "How do I protect my home from the outside weather?". This question could be posed as "How can I write down this code?" in the coding world. The answer would have to be adding a roof on your home because it blocks off the sunlight and help with the outside weather. One can keep answering those questions with the same response of just put a roof on top of your home, but in some cases you can't. What if there is snow or lots of leaves falling? You can put a roof over your home but some types of roofs won't help with those weathers, a different shaped roof must be put on so snow or leaves don't build up on the roof. Now going back to the coding world, one can apply the same "template solution", i.e a roof, to the problem/code (the home). But

## Semantic UI 
   Out of the more famous UI Frameworks, the one that I worked with was Semantic UI. Semantic UI is a high end development framework that is powered by jQuery and LESS. One of benefits of this framework is that it is a free open source interface that is already used universally amongst many website developers. When using Semantic UI in my HTML code, I noticed how easier it is to create the same result in a different way. Semantic UI has classes that are very easy to use because they are easily identifiable. If you want a part of your menu to drop down, all you have to do is call the ui class for dropdown menu. This type of syntax was very easy to use compared to using the different grammer/syntax of regular HTML code. When using Semantic UI, I was able to make transitions and behaviours easier than regular HTML. Again with the dropdown menu, if you want to make the menu dropdown upon hover, you can go on the Semantic UI website library, find the code for that behavior and copy that to your code. Using Semantic UI also made styling my website easy and made my code look more clean. <br/>
   To finish this all off, I would highly recommend using an UI Framework when developing your website. It makes it better to create because you can make it fast, more efficient and it is easy to use. There are many UI Frameworks out there that is widely used, if you find one that you find enjoyable to use, you'll see that you can create websites with ease.
