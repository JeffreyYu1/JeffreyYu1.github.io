## Design Patterns As Roofs?
   Many different people have explained Design Patterns in many different ways. To me, Design Patterns can be thought as roofs. One can pose the question, "How do I protect my home from the outside weather?". This question could be posed as "How can I write down this code?" in the coding world. The answer would have to be adding a roof on your home because it blocks off the sunlight and help with the outside weather. One can keep answering those questions with the same response of just put a roof on top of your home, but in some cases you can't. What if there is snow or lots of leaves falling? You can put a roof over your home but some types of roofs won't help with those weathers, a different shaped roof must be put on so snow or leaves don't build up on the roof. Now going back to the coding world, one can apply the same "template solution", i.e a roof, to the problem/code (the home). But the solutions applied can be altered to better fix the problems, in this case different shaped roofs. This leads to what the true defination of what Design Patterns are. Its the general repeatable template solution to a problem in software design.

## Examples of Roofs  
   One commonly used design pattern is the MVC Design Pattern, also known as Model, View and Controller Design Pattern. Back to our roof example, you can view the yourself as the user. You are ordering a roof and customizing it to fit your home. You then get to see what the new roof looks like and how it performs under the certain circumstances. You can keep customizing your roof to change the view and it's performance. This is a basic model of the MVC Design Pattern. In this Design Pattern, the user (you) uses the controller (how you customize the roof) which then manipulates the model (changes the home) and updates the view (how the roof looks on home and its performance). This type of Design Pattern is commonly used in websites where you subscribe to a subscription and use it to change your website. <br/>
   Another example of a Design Pattern used would be the factory method. Again using the roof example, you can see this in when you are building/customizing the roof. You know that you have to use a roof, so this can be viewed as you know you can use a certain interface to help with the problem. But the next problem arises, what can you do to your roof to help with different weather? You can access the roof interface and call methods that can change the roof shape, i.e make roof slanted to have snow fall off. Accessing the roof interface itself helps build a roof faster than coming up with your own way to build one because a roof is already preset on how it is made.
