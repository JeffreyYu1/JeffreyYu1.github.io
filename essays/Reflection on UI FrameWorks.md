## Why UI Frameworks?
  UI Frameworks (also know as User Interface Frameworks) are interfaces that aid in the development of front end applications and websites. There are many UI Frameworks out there like Bootstrap, Foundation, and Semantic UI. Many may say that learning any UI Framework in general is too complicated and that HTML and CSS is enough. But let me ask you this, do you think all the great websites out on the internet rely on just HTML and CSS? The answer would be no because building a good website from just those two alone would be too time consuming. We live in an era where every task thrown at us is either has to be done quickly or we just want to finish that task already.</br>
  <br/> 
  One of main benefits of using an UI Framework is that its far more efficient and faster to use. Some frameworks are designed to help you create more beautiful websites by providing you templetes/classes that help you create a basic setup for you to modify.

## My Personal Experience 
   As of the date of this essay, I have been using the coding standard ESLint with IntelliJ. My first impressions with it is that it tells you a lot of errors ranging from this variable is never used to there should be a space after this letter. Following ESLint actually helped me fix my code and adding whats missing. This is another advantage to following coding standards, its that it can actually help you finish your code. Yes getting that greencheck mark (indicates that your code follows the correct standards) is a pain to get, but getting it is very useful for your code. By getting that checkmark, it means that your code is in its simplest form (meaning your code is in its shortest form) and it can be easily be readable. Having a clean code makes group projects run more smoothly and getting help from others a lot easier
