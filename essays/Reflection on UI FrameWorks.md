## Why UI Frameworks?
  UI Frameworks (also know as User Interface Frameworks) are interfaces that aid in the development of front end applications and websites. There are many UI Frameworks out there like Bootstrap, Foundation, and Semantic UI. Many may say that learning any UI Framework in general is too complicated and that HTML and CSS is enough. But let me ask you this, do you think all the great websites out on the internet rely on just HTML and CSS? The answer would be no because building a good website from just those two alone would be too time consuming. We live in an era where every task thrown at us is either has to be done quickly or we just want to finish that task already.

  One of main benefits of using an UI Framework is that its far more efficient and faster to use. Some frameworks are designed to help you create more beautiful websites by providing you templetes/classes that help you create a basic setup for you to modify. Instead of starting from scratch for your website, you can essentially start of with a template of what you want. Using UI Frameworks can improve your desgin of your current website already. If one doesn't know how to create a certain style, some Frameworks have simpler ways of creating that style. Plus learning UI Frameworks can help you understand other websites that have used those Frameworks. If you see a Website that looks amazing to you but don't know how they made it. Looking into their source code and how they used the Framework for their website can give you an idea of what they did.

## Semantic UI 
   Out of the more famous UI Frameworks, the one that I worked with was Semantic UI. Semantic UI is a high end development framework that is powered by jQuery and LESS. One of benefits of this framework is that it is a free open source interface that is already used universally amongst many website developers. When using Semantic UI in my HTML code, I noticed how easier it is to create the same result in a different way. Semantic UI has classes that are very easy to use because they are easily identifiable. If you want a part of your menu to drop down, all you have to do is call the ui class for dropdown menu. This type of syntax was very easy to use compared to using the different grammer/syntax of regular HTML code. When using Semantic UI, I was able to make transitions and behaviours easier than regular HTML. Again with the dropdown menu, if you want to make the menu dropdown upon hover, you can go on the Semantic UI website library, find the code for that behavior and copy that to your code. Using Semantic UI also made styling my website easy and made my code look more clean. <br/>
   To finish this all off, I would highly recommend using an UI Framework when developing your website. It makes it better to create because you can make it fast, more efficient and it is easy to use. There are many UI Frameworks out there that is widely used, if you find one that you find enjoyable to use, you'll see that you can create websites with ease.
