## What Are Smart Questions? 
   In your lifetime, one will always be asking questions about anything. Whether it's about how to do a certain task or how to solve a problem, the way one asks the question will result in different answers. Smart questions are questions that have been thought though very throughly. By this means, before asking a smart question, reasearch was done beforehand to find the answer. When a lot of reasearch has been done to find the answer and it was still not found. That makes the question hold more meaning. Stating in your question that you tried to find the answer on your own and still couldn't find it will make many more experts get attracted to your questions and would want to answer it.\
   A smart question is also not just a simple, one line question like "How do I do this?" or "This doesn't work, I need help."  One would need to explain what methods were done in solving the problem. Explaining the steps that were done in solving the problem will let respondent rule out solutions in solving the problem and doesn't waste anyones time. A question that says "I have X problem, I have done Y steps already but still couldn't get the answer." is more appelling for respondents to answer. One should also not ask the question to a respondent/a community of respondents that have nothing to do with the topic. This is going to be a waste of time and no answers might be given. 

## Real Life Example of Smart Question
 [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44649988/spring-boot-actuator-health-is-not-working) is a link to a smart question that was found in StackOverflow. Immediately, the questioner is very specific on what the problem is. He gives his code and explains the steps he did when coding it. He explains that he did this code with the guidance of a tutorial page and followed it. He gives the error message that popped up the moment he thinks his code breaks and explains what he had done to attempt to solve the problem. Here this person already meets all the criteria mentioned above and asks this question within a coding community website. With this being a smart questions, there are many different respondents that were willingly to explain the steps needed to solve the problem. The respondents shared which part of his code resulted in the error and solutions on how to fix it.
