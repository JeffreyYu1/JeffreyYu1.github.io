## Why Coding Standards Are Important.
  In most coding languages, there are a set of standards that most coders follow to provide clean code. If you write messy code, you might run into errors and won't know where the errors are if your code is messy. Also having clean code helps others understand what you are trying to do. Its like writing an essay and having it read/ reviewed by someone else. They can't help you improve your essay or understand what you are trying to write if they can't read your handwriting. Same thing goes for coding. If your code doesn't follow a set of universal standards, others might not know what you are trying to do. This leads to complications if you are coding in a group or giving your code to others. This all could have been avoided if the code followed coding standards.

## Real Life Example of A Smart Question
   [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44649988/spring-boot-actuator-health-is-not-working) is a link to a smart question that was found in StackOverflow. Immediately, the questioner is very specific on what the problem is. He gives his code and explains the steps he did when coding it. He explains that he did this code with the guidance of a tutorial page and followed it. He gives the error message that popped up the moment he thinks his code breaks and explains what he had done to attempt to solve the problem. Here this person already meets all the criteria mentioned above and asks this question within a coding community website. With this being a smart questions, there are many different respondents that were willingly to explain the steps needed to solve the problem. The respondents shared which part of his code resulted in the error and solutions on how to fix it.

## Bottom Line?
   Questions are asked to fulfill the curiosity of the mind or to solve a problem. The way one asks the question will is what you will get as your answer. A simple, not thought out question will result in answers that are short and often point out that the answer is there, you just didn't read. When a question is asked with the explanation of what you have tried to do, it makes respondents appreciate the questions and makes them happy enough to answer it.
