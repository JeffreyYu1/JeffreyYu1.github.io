## Why Coding Standards Are Important.
  In most coding languages, there are a set of standards that most coders follow to provide clean code. If you write messy code, you might run into errors and won't know where the errors are if your code is messy. Also having clean code helps others understand what you are trying to do. Its like writing an essay and having it read/ reviewed by someone else. They can't help you improve your essay or understand what you are trying to write if they can't read your handwriting. Same thing goes for coding. If your code doesn't follow a set of universal standards, others might not know what you are trying to do. This leads to complications if you are coding in a group or giving your code to others. This all could have been avoided if the code followed coding standards.

## My Personal Experience 
   As of the date of this essay, I have been using the coding standard ESLint with IntelliJ. My first impressions with it is that it tells you a lot of errors ranging from this variable is never used to there should be a space after this letter. Following ESLint actually helped me fix my code and adding whats missing. This is another advantage to following coding standards, its that it can actually help you finish your code. Yes getting that greencheck mark (indicates that your code follows the correct standards) is a pain to get, but getting it is very useful for your code. By getting that checkmark, it means that your code is in its simplest form (meaning your code is in its shortest form) and it can be easily be readable. Having a clean code makes group projects run more smoothly and getting help from others a lot easier
