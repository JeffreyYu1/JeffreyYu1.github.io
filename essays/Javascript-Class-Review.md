## Javascript Refelction 
   Currently, I am learning Javascript in my ICS 314 class at Univerisity of Manoa. Before this class, I had no prior knowledge to Javascript and the only language that I have learned/practiced was Java. One could say that Java and Javascript are very similar and I can see it. Javascript is the distant cousin of Java and both of both are Object Oriented Programming languages (OOP). With that many of the language of Java can be seen when coding in Javascript.
